1. open_api_key containing the API key from OpenAI
2. telegram_api_token containing the API token for your Telegram bot
3. (optional) system_prompt containing the system prompt for the GPT model. If the prompt contains TEMPERATURE_VAL, it will be replaced with the temperature value.
4. (optional) allowed_ids containing the list of Telegram user IDs that are allowed to use the bot. If this file is not present, all users are allowed to use the bot.
